### Problem

As a DJ I know it can be quite difficult to promote yourself to get bookings. Currently social media platforms like Facebook are used but because these platforms are not built specifically for this purpose its missing much needed functionality that does not address these cases. My project aims to address the following:

- Availability: Finding a DJ who is available in your specific location for when your event is happening can often be difficult. My project should match event organisers with local DJs.
- Criteria: Each event organiser has a specific set of requirements of what they expect from their DJ. Because these vary so much it can be hard to find DJs who match this criteria. The project can take DJs preferences of type of events they are open to taking, what genres they enjoy playing, location preferences, price, equipment etc. The application can then match up organisers & DJs.
- Reviews: DJs currently heavily rely on word of mouth for recommendations and future bookings Event organisers also rely on this for reliability. Having a place where event organisers can post reviews of their experience working with a particular DJ allows DJs to build their presence up as well as providing event organisers some confidence in the DJs ability for the job.
- Pricing: DJs can have a wide range of pricing structures depending on factors such as experience, reputation, demand, equipment, and the nature of the event. This can make it difficult for organisers to find DJs based on their budget. The project should be able to match peopleâ€™s needs and budget with appropriate DJs.
- Last minute booking: A DJ may have double booked, cancelled due to illness or car/van broken down. Life happens but this project could provide a platform for people who find themselves in this unfortunate situation and allows them to quickly find a replacement DJ.
